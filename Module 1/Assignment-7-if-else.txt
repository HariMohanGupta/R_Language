#Tasks to be performed:

#  Using the placement dataset, perform the following tasks:

#placement drives".
#If it's "Not Placed", then print "The student is not placed from campus
#placement drives."
#If it's "NA", then print "The data of the student is not available."

if(Placement_Data$status[95]=="Placed") {
  print("The student is placed from campus placement drives")
}else {
  if(Placement_Data$status[95]=="Not Placed") {
    print("The student is not placed from campus placement drives")
  }else {
    print("The data of the student is not available")
  }
}


#b. Check the value of 64th row of hsc_s column.
#If it is "Science", then print "The subject opted by the student is Science."
#If it is "Commerce", then print "The subject opted by the student is Commerce."
#If it is "Arts", then print "The subject opted by the student is Arts."
  
 if(Placement_Data$hsc_s[64]=="Science") {
   print("The subject opted by the student is Science")
 } else{
   if(Placement_Data$hsc_s[64]=="Commerce") {
     print("The subject opted by the student is Commerce")
     
   } else{
     if(Placement_Data$hsc_s[64]=="Arts") {
       print("The subject opted by the student is Arts")
     }
   }
 }
 
#c. Check the 28th row of Payment method column:

if(customer_churn$PaymentMethod[28]=="Credit card (automatic)"){
  print("The customer is using credit card as their payment method")
}else{
  if(customer_churn$PaymentMethod[28]=="Mailed check"){
    print("The customer is using mailed check for payment")
  }else{
    if(customer_churn$PaymentMethod[28]=="Electronic check"){
      print("The customer is using electronic check for payment")
