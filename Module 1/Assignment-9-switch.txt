#Problem Statement:
#Implement the following questions using switch case for the following dataset:
#  1. Placement Data
#  2. Customer Churn

#Tasks to be performed:
#1. Using switch case, check 67th row of hsc_s column from placement data:
#If it is "Science", then add 5 extra marks in degree_p score.
#If it is "Commerce", then add 3 extra marks in degree_p score.

switch (as.character(Placement_Data$hsc_s[67]),
        "Science" = Placement_Data$degree_p[67]+5,
        "Commerce" = Placement_Data$degree_p[67]+3
)->Placement_Data$degree_p[67]

#2. Check 74th row of ssc_b column in the placement datasset:
#If it is "Others", then add 3 as grace marks in hsc_p for the 74th row.
#If it is "Central", then add 5 as grace marks in hsc_p for the 74th row.

switch (as.character(Placement_Data$ssc_b[74]),
  "Others" = Placement_Data$hsc_p[74]+3,
  "Central" =Placement_Data$hsc_p[74]+5
)->Placement_Data$hsc_p[74]

#3. Using switch case, check 4th row of contract column from customer churn data:
#If it is "One Year", then give a 20% discount in total charges.
#If it is "Month-to-month", then give a discount of 5% in total charges.


switch (as.character(customer_churn$Contract[4]),
  "One year" = customer_churn$TotalCharges[4]*0.8,
  "Month-to-month" = customer_churn$TotalCharges[4]*0.95
)->customer_churn$TotalCharges[4]

#4. Check 14th row of Internet Service column in the customer churn datasset:
#If the customer is using "Fiber optic", then give a discount of 15% in total charges.
#If it is "DSL", then give a discount of 10% in total charges.

switch (as.character(customer_churn$InternetService[14]),
  "Fiber optic" = customer_churn$TotalCharges[14]*0.85,
  "DSL" = customer_churn$TotalCharges[14]*0.90
)->customer_churn$TotalCharges[14]
